    "## Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. In the context of data science and mathematical modeling, machine learning plays a crucial role in building models that represent real-world systems using mathematical concepts and language. A subfield of Machine learning is Deep learning, which uses a type of models called neural networks that are inspired in the architechture of human brains.\n",

    "## Characteristics of Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning from Data:**\n",
    "   - Machine learning systems learn from data rather than relying on explicit programming by using some statistical techniques.\n",
    "   - Algorithms use available data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Development:**\n",
    "   - Machine learning involves creating models that can generalize patterns from the training data to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adaptability:**\n",
    "   - Machine learning models can adapt and evolve as new data becomes available, making them suitable for dynamic and changing environments.\n",

    "## Data Science Lifecycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science lifecycle involves several key steps that machine learning implementations follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identification of the problem:**\n",
    "   - Allows the decision on the suitable model and algorithm and definition of training and test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Collection:**\n",
    "   - Gather relevant data from various sources, ensuring it is representative and suitable for the problem at hand.\n",
    "   - It is highly important to perform exploratory analysis to evaluate the quality of the data and, if suitable, define the subsequent necessary processing steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Processing:** This is probably the most relevant step: independently of a succesful implementation of the previous steps, if the data does not contain the information relevant to solve the problem and or present in an inadequate state for the algorithm to learn from, the resulting model will be useless (garbage-in -> garbage-out). It mainly consists of two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.1. **Data Pre-processing:**\n",
    "    - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and format issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.2. **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "    - Necessary in some cases but optional in others.\n",
    "    - Select or create features that are relevant and informative for the machine learning model.\n",
    "    - Common approaches are grouped into *Filter-based*, *Wrapper-based* and *Embedded-based* categories.\n",
    "   \n",
    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data modelling:** During this iterative process, each model's performance is assessed using different metrics depending if the algorithm works with categorical or continous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.1. **Model Training:**\n",
    "    - Use a learning algorithm to train the model on a labeled dataset, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.2. **Model Optimization:**\n",
    "    - Adjust model parameters and features to improve performance, often involving techniques like hyperparameter tuning. Within this step it is important to avoid overfitting (the model could be generalized to datasets beyond the training ones).\n",
    "\n",
    "    <!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.3. **Model Testing:**\n",
    "    - Validate the model on new, unseen data to ensure it generalizes well (without overfitting) and provides accurate predictions (without underfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",

    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is broadly categorized into several types, each serving different purposes and solving distinct problems. Here are the main types:\n",

    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a **labeled** dataset, where each input is paired with the corresponding output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, and hence, **predict an output based on input**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usefulness of these models is evaluated immediately since both the input and corresponding correct outputs are provided in the testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Regression:**\n",
    "   - **Objective:** Predict a continuous target variable.\n",
    "   - **Examples:** Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Classification:**\n",
    "   - **Objective:** Predict a discrete target variable (class labels).\n",
    "   - **Examples:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees or Random Forest and Support Vector Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning involves training on **unlabeled** data, and the algorithm tries to **discover patterns or relationships in the data** without explicit guidance on the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the output is unknown in the training data, the usefulness is implicitly derived from the structure and relationships discovered in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Clustering:**\n",
    "   - **Objective:** Group similar data points together.\n",
    "   - **Examples:** K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Dimensionality Reduction:**\n",
    "   - **Objective:** Reduce the number of input features while preserving important information. It is also commonly used as a pre-processing step for feature extraction.\n",
    "   - **Examples:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Association Rule Learning:** It will not be covered on this course.\n",
    "   - **Objective:** Discover interesting relationships between variables in large datasets.\n",
    "   - **Examples:** Apriori Algorithm, Eclat Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning involves an **agent interacting with an environment**, learning to make decisions by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties (mimics the human trial and error behaviour). Hence, the objective is to **learn a policy to make decisions achieving the most optimal result**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On this type of algorithms, the performance depends on the environment provided by the agent (reward or penalty) after each action, guiding it towards learning a successful policy for optimization (https://www.youtube.com/@aiwarehouse). It is usually employed for training AI for videogames rather than on -omics data analysis, so it won't be covered on this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Model-Based Reinforcement Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Objective:** Build an explicit model of the environment to make decisions.\n",
    "   - **Examples:** Monte Carlo Tree Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Model-Free Reinforcement Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Objective:** Learn to make decisions without an explicit model of the environment.\n",
    "   - **Examples:** Q-Learning, Deep Q Network (DQN)."

    "## Relationship with Statistical Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pattern Recognition:**\n",
    "   - Machine learning involves finding patterns in data, a concept deeply rooted in statistics.\n",
    "   - Depeding on the types of problem, and hence, the employed algorithm, different kinds of patterns can be extracted from data.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-Validation:** A key concept for supervised models when the available dataset is smaller than the optimal for the validation purposes.\n",
    "   - To assess a supervised model's generalization ability, cross-validation techniques are used to evaluate performance on multiple subsets of the data.\n",
    "   - There are multiple methodologies (https://www.turing.com/kb/different-types-of-cross-validations-in-machine-learning-and-their-explanations) although the most common is the **K-fold cross-validation** which involves partitioning the entire dataset into k number of random subsets, where k-1 are used for training and 1 for testing purposes. This is repeated for a number of iterations and the model is evaluated through the metrics obtained across interations.\n",

    "<!-- Add an empty line here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:** Also a key concept when dealing with supervised models.\n",
    "   - In statistics, the bias of an estimator is the difference between this estimator’s expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated. On the other hand, the variance of an estimator measures how much the estimates from the estimator are likely to vary or spread out around the true, unknown parameter, through repeated sampling.\n",

    "   - If we consider Machine learning predictions as estimations these two concepts acquire the following meaning in this context. \n",
    "       \n",
    "       - **Variance** is the consistency of the model predictions for a particular sample instance (for instance applying the model multiple times on subsets of the training dataset). In other words, is the sensitivity of the model to the randomness of the training dataset.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       - In contrast, **Bias** could be seen as the measure of the distance between predictions and the correct values (the labels) if we rebuild the model multiple times with different training datasets. Therefore, is the measure of the systematic error not due to randomness in the training data.\n",
    "             \n",
    "   - These two concepts are intrinsically related, and therefore, the bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning: there is an optimal model complexity that allows for good performance on the training data but still keeping the ability to generalize to new data. Deviations from these optimal area leads to either high bias (underfitting, there is still room to improve the model though training) or high variance (overfitting, excessive training on a specific dataset and unable to generalize to similar test datasets) of the model.\n",

    "PCA is a statistical technique that on an n-dimensional matrix of values that:\n",

    "- Identifies the directions (specific axis in the matrix) at which, if the rest of the data is projected into, the data varies the most: the principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Represents the data in a new coordinate system defined by these principal components.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Therefore, the key idea is to find a lower-dimensional representation of the data that captures the maximum amount of variance. Hence, the first principal component is the one that captures the most significant amount of variance in the data, followed by the second principal component, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, the algorithm follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PCA starts by computing the **covariance matrix** of the original data, which represents the relationships between the different features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eigenvectors and eigenvalues** are extracted from the covariance matrix. The **eigenvectors** are the principal components and the **eigenvalues** indicate the variance along each principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The **eigenvectors** are sorted in descending order based on the **eigenvalues**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The dimensionality of the data is reduced and the data is transformed **linearly** into a new coordinate system aligned with the an amount of first principal components depending on the new dimensionality.\n",

    "2. **Construct Probability Distributions:** The pairwise similarities are converted into probability distributions. In the high-dimensional space a Gaussian distribution is used to represent the similarities while in the low-dimensional space is a Student's t-distribution (this distribution has heavier tails compared to the Gaussian making it more flexible and better suited for capturing local structures).\n",

    "$$w^\\prime_i \\leftarrow w_i + \\alpha \\cdot (y - \\hat{y}) \\cdot x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $w_i$ is the weight associated with the $i$-th input feature.\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is the learning rate, a small positive constant of range [0, 1] that determines the step size in weight updates.\n",
    "- $y$ is the true label (the actual class of the instance).\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted output of the perceptron.\n",
    "- $x_i$ is the $i$-th input feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the **learning rule** of the perceptron essentially adjusts the weights to reduce the difference between the predicted output ($\\hat{y}$) and the true label ($y$), where the term $(y - \\hat{y})$ represents the error of prediction at iteration $i$-th. With this, the weights are updated in the direction that minimizes this error at a **learning rate** $\\alpha$. This constant is defined as an hyperparameter in order to maximize the search for the optimal solution: with a too small value, the alrgorithm will take too much time and computational resources to find the optimal solution (and also it might get stucked in local optimums) whereas a too large learning rate the algorithm might not use properly the gradient to find the optimas.\n",

    "- Perceptrons are **limited to linear separability** (can only learn linear decision boundaries).\n",
    "- Sensitivity to Outliers: Outliers can significantly impact perceptron performance.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Hence, the logit function maps any real-valued number to the range [0, 1], which is crucial for interpreting the output as a probability, and thus, assign each element to a given class based on the ratio of probabilities.

    "Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes in feature space. The hyperplane is defined by:\n",

    "- $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast with the perceptron, where the objective was to minimized misclassification errors, in SVMs the optimization objective is to **maximize the margin** (the **learning rule** of SVM), defined as the distance between the separating hyperplane (the decision boundary) and the training samples that are closest to this hyperplane, which are the so-called **support vectors** (the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary). This is illustrated in the following figure:\n",

    "The rationale behind having decision boundaries with large margins is that they tend to have a lower generalization error (the decision boundaries are less influenced by the training dataset) whereas models such as the perceptron with small margins are more prone to fall into **overitting** issues. However, as you might understand, this concept of **maximizing the margins** is therorethically suitable if there is an hyperplane that is able to separate all the training groups. But what about cases where that is impossible? How can we build a good enough model in this situation where margins are not that clear?\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess that the algorithm takes into account a concept known as **soft-margin classification**, where an internal extra parameter called **slack variable** (see the bibliography for mathematical details) allows to relax the constrains for nonlinearly separable data to allow convergence of the optimization in the presence of misclassifications under the appropriate cost penalization. This is controlled by an **hyperparameter of the model C** where increasing values of C increases the bias and lowers the variance of the model to adjust for the **bias-variance** tradeoff:\n",

There is no architecture that is optimal for all kind of problems and which specific architecture is best to use depends on the problem at hand. Moreover, this kind of decision usually involves **trial and error** with multiple candidates, as happens at the original implementation on Kaggle.\n",

This CNN network has 5 layers (hence its name): 3 sets of convolution layers with a combination of average pooling, followed by 2 fully connected layers with a Softmax classifier. Our implementation is going to be more simple from the ones at Kaggle, as we will not use the RGB information and we will just work with greyscale images (we will loose part of the information from the tincture at the histology)."
